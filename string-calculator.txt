Do not rush, take your time, we want to see your best work!
Send us the link to your repo once you’re happy with what you’ve done
Based on the instructions below:- We would love to see a working example of how you code!

1.Please code this in Java or any other preferred language using TDD. You will need to commit your code to Git and send us a link to the repo. Make sure to commit your repo multiple times so that it highlights each step of TDD separately, and we can see how your code evolves.

2.If you're not comfortable using TDD, we recommend learning the techniques before you take the assessment. We recommend that you watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkblc5WRn-U&t=3s before attempting the assessment if you are new to TDD. If you’re a pro, go right ahead!
